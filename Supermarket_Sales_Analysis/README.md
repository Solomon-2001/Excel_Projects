Business Recommendations
Increase focus on Food & Beverages and Sports & Travel products
Since Food & Beverages generates the highest revenue and Sports & Travel also performs strongly, the business should prioritise stock availability, promotions, and bundle offers in these categories to maximise revenue.
Improve performance of the Health & Beauty category
Health & Beauty produces the lowest revenue. Targeted discounts, improved in-store placement, and marketing campaigns could help boost demand in this underperforming category.
Optimise staffing and promotions around peak sales days
Since Tuesday is the highest performing day, staff levels should be increased on this day to handle higher customer demand efficiently.
Conversely, Monday promotions could be introduced to stimulate sales on the lowest-performing day.
Leverage high-spending Member customers
Members spend more on average than normal customers. The business should expand its loyalty and rewards programme to encourage repeat purchases and convert more normal customers into members.
Focus marketing activity during peak evening hours
With 7 PM identified as the peak sales hour, targeted promotions, flash sales, and staff scheduling should be aligned with this time window to capture the highest possible revenue.
Encourage digital payments while maintaining all payment options
Since revenue is evenly distributed across Cash (35%), E-wallet (34%), and Credit Card (31), the business should continue supporting all payment methods while promoting E-wallet usage through small incentives such as loyalty points or cash back to improve checkout efficiency and reduce cash-handling costs.
